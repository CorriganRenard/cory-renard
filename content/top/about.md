<img src="/coryrenard.jpg" alt="Cory Renard" align="right" width="400">

I am a developer and systems administrator.

Having been coding here and there since 2007, I started my journey in earnest in January of 2015.

I have worked with a wide range of technologies from C# and .net to Javascript, Python and Go.

I am the father of two beautiful twin girls and husband to a pro videographer.  We currently make our home between the mountains and the sea, in the sprawling forests of the Pacific Northwest.
